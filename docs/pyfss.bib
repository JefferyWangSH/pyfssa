    abstract = {Critical phenomena in films of finite thickness are considered. A detailed scaling theory, with allowance for distinct exponents \\$\\lambda\\$ and \\$\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\nu}\\$ for the critical-point shift and rounding, respectively, is confirmed by exact calculations on d-dimensional ferromagnetic spherical models and ideal Bose fluids with various boundary conditions. Isingmodel results and existing data on real helium films are consistent with the theory.},

@book{Newman1999Monte,
    abstract = {{This book provides an introduction to Monte Carlo simulations in classical statistical physics and is aimed both at students beginning work in the field and at more experienced researchers who wish to learn more about Monte Carlo methods. The material covered includes methods for both equilibrium and out of equilibrium systems, and common algorithms like the Metropolis and heat-bath algorithms are discussed in detail, as well as more sophisticated ones such as continuous time Monte Carlo, cluster algorithms, multigrid methods, entropic sampling and simulated tempering. Data analysis techniques are also explained starting with straightforward measurement and error-estimation techniques and progressing to topics such as the single and multiple histogram methods and finite size scaling. The last few chapters of the book are devoted to implementation issues, including discussions of such topics as lattice representations, efficient implementation of data structures, multispin coding, parallelization of Monte Carlo algorithms, and random number generation. At the end of the book the authors give a number of example programs demonstrating the applications of these techniques to a variety of well-known models.}},
