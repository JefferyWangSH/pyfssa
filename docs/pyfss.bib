@misc{Melchert2009AutoScalepy,
    abstract = {{autoScale}.py is a program that performs an automatic finite-size scaling
analysis for given sets of simulated data. It implements a quite general
scaling assumption and optimizes an initial set of scaling parameters that
enforce a data collapse of the different data sets. The presented guide
describes how the program works, it presents a detailed example and finally
gives some hints on how to improve the results of a scaling analysis.},

@article{Wenzel2008Percolation,
    abstract = {The compact Abelian Higgs model is simulated on a cubic lattice where it possesses vortex lines and pointlike magnetic monopoles as topological defects. The focus of this high-precision Monte Carlo study is on the vortex network, which is investigated by means of percolation observables. In the region of the phase diagram where the Higgs and confinement phases are separated by a first-order transition, it is shown that the vortices percolate right at the phase boundary, and that the first-order nature of the transition is reflected by the network. In the crossover region, where the phase boundary ceases to be first order, the vortices are shown to still percolate. In contrast to other observables, the percolation observables show finite-size scaling. The exponents characterizing the critical behavior of the vortices in this region are shown to fall in the random percolation universality class.},

    abstract = {Data collapse is a way of establishing scaling and extracting associated exponents in problems showing self-similar or self-affine characteristics as, for example, in equilibrium or non-equilibrium phase transitions, in critical phases, in dynamics of complex systems and many others.  We propose a measure to quantify the nature of data collapse. Via a minimization of this measure, the exponents and their error-bars can be obtained.  The procedure is illustrated by considering finite-size-scaling near phase transitions and quite strikingly recovering the exact exponents.},

@article{Kawashima1993Critical,
    abstract = {The three-dimensional ± J Ising spin glass model is investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulation. In uniform fields of various strength, the {Edwards-Anderson} susceptibility χ {EA} Q is calculated at T =0.9 J which is lower than the transition temperature in the zero-field case. It is found that χ {EA} decreases monotonically when the field strength is increased and that the data do not suggest a phase transition in a finite field. The best parameters for the scaling function of the form {χEA}({H)≃lψχ\~{}EA}(({H−Hc})l−ϕ) are estimated to be H c =0.00(10) J , ψ=2.16(22) and φ=-1.13(6). These results support the hypothesis that the phase transition does not exist in a finite magnetic field. \sloppy},

@article{Houdayer2004Lowtemperature,
    abstract = {We perform Monte Carlo simulations of large two-dimensional Gaussian Ising spin glasses down to very low temperatures {β=1∕T}=50. Equilibration is ensured by using a cluster algorithm including Monte Carlo moves consisting of flipping fundamental excitations. We study the thermodynamic behavior using the Binder cumulant, the spin-glass susceptibility, the distribution of overlaps, the overlap with the ground state, and the specific heat. We confirm that Tc=0. All results are compatible with an algebraic divergence of the correlation length with an exponent ν. We find −1∕ν=−0.295(40), which is compatible with the value for the domain-wall and droplet exponent θ≈−0.29 found previously in ground-state studies. Hence the thermodynamic behavior of this model seems to be governed by one single exponent.},

@book{Newman1999Monte,

The material covered includes methods for both equilibrium and out of equilibrium systems, and common algorithms like the Metropolis and heat-bath algorithms are discussed in detail, as well as more sophisticated ones such as continuous time Monte Carlo, cluster algorithms, multigrid methods, entropic sampling and simulated tempering. Data analysis techniques are also explained starting with straightforward measurement and error-estimation techniques and progressing to topics such as the single and multiple histogram methods and finite size scaling. The last few chapters of the book are devoted to implementation issues, including discussions of such topics as lattice representations, efficient implementation of data structures, multispin coding, parallelization of Monte Carlo algorithms, and random number generation. At the end of the book the authors give a number of example programs demonstrating the applications of these techniques to a variety of well-known models.}},
